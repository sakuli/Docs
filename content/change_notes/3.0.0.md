### Node

From now on, Sakuli also supports the latest LTS version of Node (v16.x, codename `lts/gallium`),
so feel free to update your systems to the latest LTS version.
We have updated our containers accordingly to run on `lts/gallium` as of 3.0.0.
In the same process, we no longer support Node 10, as it is no longer supported.
