# V2.5.0

## Sakuli Core

The new Sakuli Release 2.5.0 has many improvements in its luggage, which both users and developers have longed for. 
In addition, a completely new option for automation made it into the release! We are talking about the Sakuli OCR 
module. But everything in the right order! Let's get it started with the improvements on the Sakuli core! A detailed 
list of all applied enhancement and fixes can be found in the
[CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/sakuli/sakuli/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md).

### CI log mode
Since Sakuli is often used in combination with (test) automation tools, it was sometimes very difficult to get the
information from the log files. That's why we introduced log modes. With the help of the "CI" log mode, the log messages
are written directly to the console. That makes access in the context of automation significantly easier. For more 
information, please have a look at the [log mode documentation](https://sakuli.io/docs/configuring_tests/logging/#log-modes)

### Decrypt secrets on cli
It is now possible to use the [sakuli decrypt](https://sakuli.io/docs/cli/#sakuli-decrypt) cli command to decrypt secrets
providing the master key used for encryption. This allows you to receive already encrypted secrets as human-readable text
for e.g. debugging purposes.

### `testCase.startStep()`
As `testCase.endOfStep()` comes with some limitations in terms of monitoring integration, we introduced 
`testCase.startStep()`. This also deprecates `testCase.endOfStep()`. We highly encourage users to use `startStep()` 
instead. For more information, please have a look at the
[startStep API docs](https://sakuli.io/apidoc/sakuli-legacy/interfaces/testcase.html#startstep).
