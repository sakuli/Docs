# What you need

Sakuli only supports the current LTS release of Node (LTS/Fermium).

In order to be able to run Sakuli on your system, we will assume that you have a working node installation.

To install Node on your system, you can either go to the <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank">Node website</a> or you can use tools like <a href="https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm" target="_blank">Node Version Manager</a> utility to manage various Node versions on a per-user basis. In general, a per-user installation is the preferred way since it runs in an unprivileged mode.
