# What you need

Sakuli is built and tested against the current LTS version of Node.js.
In order to be able to run Sakuli on your system, we will assume that you have a Node v10.15.3 (lts/dubnium) installed on it.

To install Node on your system, you can either go to the [Node website](https://nodejs.org/en/) or you can use tools like [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), a utility to manage various Node versions on a per-user basis. In general, a per-user installation is the preferred way since it runs in an unprivileged mode.
